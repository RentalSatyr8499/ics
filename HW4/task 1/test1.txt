SOCRATES: I was just about to cross the river, my friend, when my familiar divine sign came to me, which stops me from time to time when I'm about to do something. I seemed to hear a sudden voice telling me not to leave until I have purified myself from some offence or other which I have committed against the realm of the gods. Now, I may not be a very good one, but I am a seer. I'm like people who are bad at writing: I'm good enough only for my own purposes. And so I do already understand beyond the shadow of a doubt what my offence was. After all, the soul too has something of the same ability that seers possess. Just now, when I was delivering my speech, something disturbed me, and I was rather worried, as Ibycus says, 'lest the cost of winning honour among men is that I sin in the eyes of the gods'. But now I see where I went wrong.

PHAEDRUS: And that is?

SOCRATES: It was an awful speech, Phaedrus, just awful...the one you brought with you, and the one you forced me to make.

PHAEDRUS: That's what we're told.

SOCRATES: But that wasn't what we were told by Lysias, nor was it in your speech, the one for which you bewitched me into being your mouthpiece. But if Love is a god, or at least divine, as indeed he is, he cannot be bad, but both the speeches which have just been given about him made him out to be bad. Not only did they commit this offence against Love, but their stupidity attained exquisite heights: although everything they said was unsound and false, they gave themselves solemn airs as if they were important, to see if they could deceive some pathetic people into admiring them. And so I must purify myself, my friend.
