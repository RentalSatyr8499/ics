<h1>Intro Cybersecurity homeworks</h1>
This is where I work through homeworks for my intro cybersecurity class that I am taking this semester (Fall 2025). If you are looking for the most accurate, up-to-date reflection of my current coding style, I would look at my <a href="https://github.com/RentalSatyr8499/ics/blob/main/HW%206/fuzzer.py">fuzzer code</a> from HW 6. 
* HW 3: Implemented the RSA algorithm (encryption, decryption, cracking, and signing) using small values of p and q.
* HW 4: Created attacks based on several hashing-based vulnrabilities (forcing collisions in CRC-16, guessing passwords using a dictionary attack, checking if passwords have not been changed enough)
* HW 5: Created a keylogger using the pynput library.
* HW 6: Created a URL fuzzer using the urllib.request library, and tested the fuzzer using the uvicorn library.
